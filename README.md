Jasmine is made to help you get into investing while making sure you avoid the noise. Don't be baited by the news about "popular" stocks/companies or potentially huge gains from betting on a company. Instead, Jasmine has two API endpoints which access BlackRock's Aladdin, which in turn, returns financial information that Jasmine uses to show users the advantages of diversification.
